# Use "Protocol Buffers" serialization from your .NET code #

## Introduction ##

**protocol buffers** is the name of the binary serialization format used by Google for much of their data communications. It is designed to be:

  * small in size - efficient data storage (far smaller than xml)
  * cheap to process - both at the client and server
  * platform independent - portable between different programming architectures
  * extensible - to add new data to old messages

**protobuf-net** is a .NET implementation of this, allowing you to serialize your .NET objects efficiently and easily. It is compatible with most of the .NET family, including .NET 2.0/3.0/3.5, .NET CF 2.0/3.5, Mono 2.x, Silverlight 2, etc.

## The short version ##

(see also the [old home page](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-net/wiki/HomePagePre2))

Serialization is a pain. protobuf-net is designed to be easily used on **_your existing code_** with minimal changes (of from an optional .proto schema), enabling fast and portable binary serialization on a wide range of .NET platforms.

Rather than being "a protocol buffers implementation that happens to be on .NET", it is a ".NET serializer that happens to use protocol buffers" - the emphasis is on being familiar to .NET users (for example, working on mutable, code-first classes if you want). I've also added a range of commonly requested features _beyond_ the regular protobuf design, to help meet the every-day demands of .NET programmers (inheritance, reference-tracking, etc).

Usage is very simple; at the most basic level, simply read from a stream or write to a stream; see [Getting Started](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-net/wiki/GettingStarted):

```
// write to a file
Serializer.Serialize(outputStream, person);

...

// read from a file
var person = Serializer.Deserialize<Person>(inputStream);
```

Oh, and it is very fast; both in CPU and in bandwidth.

There is some VS tooling if you want to work from .proto files in visual studio, but you _don't need that_ - you can just write a class, tell the serializer how to work with it (most commonly by adding a few attributes, but that is up to you), and serialize away.

## "v2" released ##

"v2" is a major overhaul to the core engine to allow much greater flexibility, and avoid a number of problems with over-use of generics. It is wire-compatible with your existing data, and the old API still exists. Simply: the library is much cleaner and leaner, and is much more versatile for onwards development. In particular v2 allows:

  * allow use on more platforms (iOS, WP7, Mono for Android, WinRT, etc)
  * allow use without attributes if you wish
  * allow pre-generation of a serialization assembly, to remove all reflection at runtime
  * and generally: just more features
